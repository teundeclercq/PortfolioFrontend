# ðŸ’½ S4 FrontendPortfolio ðŸ’½

This is the frontend for the personal project I did in semester 4 on Graduate school Fontys Tilburg.
The project idea was to create a portfolio website where users could create an account and then add pictures and documents to it.
The project was made with Angular 7. 

## ðŸš§ NPM

Run `npm install` to install the node_modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ðŸ‘· Running unit tests 

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## ðŸŽ« Authentication

The authentication does not work at the moment. It is made with Firebase. The firebase server doesn't exist anymore.
